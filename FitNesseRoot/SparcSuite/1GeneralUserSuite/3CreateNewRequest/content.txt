#Ideas to come back to:

#"Save as Draft" button at some point through workflow.

#Messing with Arms in Step 2A

#Commenting up each page so we know what each step is doing.

#Step 2B is only focused on checking each tab - should more be added?

#Checking the Get Cost Estimate - do we want to this whole thing 2?

#There'd be 2 request, one get cost and one submit to start. one would be non patient and one would be patient services.
